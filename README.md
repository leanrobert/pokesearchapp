# Pokemon Search App

The Pokemon Search app is a simple web using little resources to diplay pokemons, their sprite and their types.

The usage is very simple, just type the name and if it exists, it will show you the info, otherwise an error message will display for 3 seconds

This is a challenge for StackUp, where Classes, Switchs and Try Catch block are required
